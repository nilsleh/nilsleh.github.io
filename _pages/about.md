I am currently a PhD Student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), supervised by [Prof. Jonathan Bamber](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/jonathan-l-bamber) and [Prof. Xiaoxiang Zhu](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/zhu-xiaoxiang), working on uncertainty quantification for sea-level rise. More broadly my interests lie in Bayesian Deep Learning, uncertainty quantification and generative modeling for Earth Observational data.  I am also very passionate about open-source software and a maintainer of [TorchGeo](https://github.com/torchgeo/torchgeo) and author of [Lighting-UQ-Box](https://github.com/lightning-uq-box/lightning-uq-box).
